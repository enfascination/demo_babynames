Baby Names Project
=======================================================================

These are example programs for use in Python training.  Detail about this project is kept in the CDSW wiki:

http://wiki.communitydata.cc/Baby_Names

In the original workshops, teachers introduce and walk through
the three example programs included in this archive (i.e.,
babynames1.py, babynames2.py, and babynames3.py).

After we have introduced these files, we will walk through a set of
coding challenges or exercises. The recommended exercises are
detailed here although we encourage learners to explore, play, and try
things out:
